        \\\\\\ here are some llm produced suggestions :

Redundancy:
Keywords like "Java" and "JavaScript" are distinct, but variations like "Javascript" and "JavaScript" introduce unnecessary duplication.
Similar cases include "node.js" vs. "nodejs" or "HTML/CSS" vs. "html css".

Noise in Keywords:
Traits like "hard-working," "honest," and "responsible" are present but aren't actionable for matching.
These can be deprioritized or removed.

Irrelevant Additions:
Generic terms like "teamwork" or "problem-solving" dilute the focus on technical or domain-specific skills.

Semantic Standardization:
Grouping related keywords (e.g., "Python 3", "python 2", and "python") under a broader category might improve relevance.
